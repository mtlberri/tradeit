## Installation

### CocoaPods

Install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

Go to your project directory and create a `Podfile` with:

```bash
$ pod init
```

Add these lines to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'TemporaryAlert'
end
```

Finally, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Manually

Drag the whole project into your workspace, build it, and add the framework to the Embedded Binaries of your project.

## Known issues

Xcode might generate a warning like this:
```bash
<UIVisualEffectView 0x0123456789> is being asked to animate its opacity. This will cause the effect to appear broken until opacity returns to 1.
```
However, you can safely ignore it. The result is as expected.
Anyone with a fix is welcome to create a pull request =).
